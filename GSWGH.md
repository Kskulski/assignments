while loop != 1(
    userInput = input()
    if userInput == ""(
        secondPress = time.time()
        currentTime = startTime - secondPress
        timeSincePress = firstPress - secondPress
        print("It has been %s seconds since starting the program and %s seconds since you last checked." % (time.time() - start.time()),())    
        firstPress = secondPress
    )elif userInput == 1(
        loop = 1
